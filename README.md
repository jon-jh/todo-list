The purpose of this code is to create a simple task management system.

newTask Function: This function creates a new task object with a title, description, and a complete status (initially set to false). 

It also includes two methods:
logTaskState: Logs the current state of the task (whether it has been completed or not).
markComplete: Marks the task as complete by setting complete to true.


Creating Tasks: Two tasks are created using the newTask function:
task1: “Clean cat litter” with the description “Take all the 💩 out of the litter box”.
task2: “Do Laundry” with the description “Clean clothes are nice!”.

Array of Tasks: The tasks are stored in an array called tasksAll.
Logging Task States: The commented-out logAll function is designed to log the state of all 
tasks in the tasksAll array.

Task State Logging and Completion: The code demonstrates logging the state of task2, marking it as complete, and then logging its state again to show the change.
